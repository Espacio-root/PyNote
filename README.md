# PyNote
PyNotes is a Python-based project designed to simplify the process of note-taking while you attend an online webinar or simply wish to neatly store screenshots for later revisions...

It takes 3 optional arguments

--default-path='path' : Allows the user to specify a default path. The both will hereafter store any new data in the said directory unless specified otherwise

--last-path : Stores any new data in its last used directory. Overrides --default-path

--audio-on: [Experimental] A sound effect is played after each action
